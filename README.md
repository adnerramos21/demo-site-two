# SiteDemoTwo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Project 

For this project I used greensock libray to facilitate the animation. If you want to see the project in action go to: https://aramos-demo-site-two.herokuapp.com/

## How does it work

If you scroll all the way down a "Watch Video" button will appear, which will take you to a small video

If you click on "Discover", it will take you to the discover page with a carousel with pictures of models, click on any of the pictures and it will show a beautiful animation with information about the selection.
